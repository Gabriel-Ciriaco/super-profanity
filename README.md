	<h1>Super-Profanity
		<br/>
			<sub>A profanity filter that lives up to its name.</sub>
	</h1>
		<h4>An advanced profanity filter based on phonetics and normal detection that detects swears in 27 different languages!</h4>
</div>

---

* Tells you what and where swears were detected.
* A very resistant and effective filter against bypassing attempts.
* Detects words with special characters such as "@ssh0le".
* Custom options to help with your needs!

---

### Usage

```js
const { profanity } = require("super-profanity");
const result = profanity(
  "Stick your dentures in your @   ss and go f *c k i n g home laughing."
);
console.log(result);

/*
{
  badWordLanguage: 'en'
  detectedWord: '@  ss'
  isBadWord: true
  profanityWordRelated: 'ass'
}
*/
```

---

### Main Language

Although it tries its best, `super-profanity` is far from perfect... Thus, to guarantee that the code will check for swears in a desired language,
you have the option to select your main language, which by default is *English*. The main language will **always** be checked in the provided sentence.

Use `changeMainLanguage` if needed.

````js
const { changeMainLanguage } = require("super-profanity");

changeMainLanguage('pt');

/*
Changed main language from en to pt.
*/
````

---

### Useful functions

*/
